# SIMPLE BUCKET LIST APP

## Description
---
    This is my first attempt at creating an app, going heavy on Vanilla JavaScript. This is a common tool that allows users to write down their goals, experiences or achievements they would like to accomplish in a laidback and easygoing way.

## Features
---
    1. __List Display:__ Explore all the items on your bucket list, quickly checking and reviewing all the listed items.
    
    2. __Add New Lists:__ You can use an add button (represented by an icon) to include new items to your list.

    3. __Achievement Tracking:__ Mark items on your bucket list as achieved once you've completed them. If you accidentally marked an item, it's easy to unmark them.

    4. __User-friendly Interface:__ Explore a clean and simple interface that's all about keeping things straightforward. It's easy to move around and interact with it.

    5. __Data Storage:__ Your list stays intact even if you close and reopen the app, unless you choose to delete it voluntarily.

    6. __Date & Time:__ It features a date and time function that shows the current date and time based on your device.
